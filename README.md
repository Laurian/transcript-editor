[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bbc/transcript-editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexnorton/transcript-editor) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/transcript-editor.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/transcript-editor)

Transcript editor, implemented as a React component. Allows correction of errors in Speech to Text engine while maintaining word-level timing information. Built using [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/).

Uses the [transcript-model](https://github.com/alexnorton/transcript-model) transcript representation format.

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This project is very much pre-alpha. The edge-case handling, test coverage and general code quality all leave a lot to be desired. Any contributions, suggestions or comments are very welcome.

Some things I'd like to work on:

- Improving test coverage
- Refactoring horrible logic spaghetti code
- Presenting a better API
- Improving performance
- Fixing bugs
